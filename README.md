This program is used to create extremely sensitive models of solid-state diffusion that represent conditions of crystal growth in the Earth's crust.  Prior to these simulations, only the final state of the system was explicitly fit by the simulation.  However, several paths to the final state are possible, so constraints on the start and intermediate steps can allow tight fits to the measured data.  This figure shows 2D images of the model through four time steps.

The new constraints come from crystal chemical zoning, which is analogous to tree rings.  The core of the tree is the first step in growth, and each consecutive ring represents additional growth stages.

The chemistry of some crystals changes over the duration of the event, which is recorded in the crystals in zones like the rings of a tree.  By fitting the model to those changes, we now have the highest fidelity simulations available for these conditions.  This allows very tightly constrained determinations of diffusion and other kinetic parameters of crystallization.


The images below represent output from plotSim, including the chemical zoning calibration (shown in "Measured garnet zoning profile", spline fit) and a key measure of model fit (shown in "Relative nucleation time").
